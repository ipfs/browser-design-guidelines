Discovery is about building understanding. Its purpose is to explore and discover intent, desired outcomes, user needs, organisational goals and context to help discern what the challenges and needs really are. 

## Research

### Methodology and approaches

### Survey of existing browser landscape

[ Survey of browser URL bar implementation ][2]

### Non-expert research

#### Why research non-experts?

#### Key questions for non-experts

1. What do you do on the Internet?
2. Which browser do you use? Does it matter? When? Mobile or desktop?
3. Where do you usually go on the Internet? How do you usually get there?
4. Do you ever type an address (URL) in? If so, when?
5. Do you ever look at the URL? Why or why not?
6. What do you think happens in it? Why?
7. Anywhere else you think these sorts of things could happen?
8. Do you know what peer-to-peer means? What are your thoughts about it?
