## Design hypothesis

Initial assumptions

Research findings

Key wider landscape questions

‘Pulling it all together’ questions

Survey review used for setting context both for range of users (i.e. turbo onramp) and for use in quickly orienting people in future reports, presentations, etc. This could help identify the set of visual components present, what they communicate and future work.
