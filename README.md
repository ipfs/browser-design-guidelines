# IPFS Browser Design Guidelines
Guidelines and recommendations for browser vendor design and implementation of IPFS

## Research

> Background

> Methodology and approaches

> Examine and explore the use-cases for IPFS in browsers, and publish design guidelines and recommendations for browser vendor implementation

### Non-expert research

We conducted research with seven participants, spread geographically and across genders and occupations to determine their conceptions, concerns and ideas about addressing conventions and P2P technologies in modern browsers. 

In depth interviews with notes and findings are found in the [wiki][1].

1. [Nina][2]
2. [Charlotte][3]
3. [Aleks][4]
4. [Dom][5]
5. [Basil][6]
6. [Jon][7]
7. [Matthew][8]

### Expert research

An expert/stakeholder workshop was conducted in conjunction to the ongoing expert interviews to explore the problem space, relevant technology and possible solutions.

In depth interviews with notes and findings are found in the [wiki][9].

1. [Ed1][10]
2. [T][11]
3. [Ed2][12]
4. [James][13]
5. **[Yiannis][14]**
6. [**Tiff**][15]

## Design hypothesis

#### Initial assumptions (WIP)

- The URL is very important

#### Research findings (WIP)

- The URL is only important as a backup and source of credibility that the right things are happening in the browser

#### Key design and user context questions (WIP)

- Setting context both for range of users (i.e. turbo onramp) and for use in quickly orienting people
- Identifying the set of visual components present, what they communicate and future work

## Design

The intent of the design phase of the IPFS Browser Design Guidelines is to examine and explore the use-cases for IPFS in browsers, and publish design guidelines and recommendations for browser vendor implementation

#### Programme of work

- Interaction and user experience design work to solve the researched issues, mapping out user flows, design patterns and use cases
- Interface design

#### Deliverables

- Screen designs including recommendations, iconographic and design treatments for existing browser URL bars
- User experience flows
- Design guidelines and component design to inform and help further development efforts
- Recommendations for further work
